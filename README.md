# dataset

This is a dataset of Arabic Vowels. 

This dataset can be used to implement simple machine learning models to detect Arabic vowels from recorded pseech patterns

Each file contains MFCC coeffecients of pre-detected vowel

Hope this dataset can help you to implement your model.

This files will updated more next weeks. 

Thanks :)
